  "body": "In this Project I use the Kaggle Bike sharing dataset to predict the sales of bike given a Multivariate Time series. I model the multivariate data using ensemble of  Random Forests and Gradient Boosting trees. After that the residuals of the model are fit with an ARMA/ARIMA/SARIMA model and later forecasted. The residuals are later added back to the predicted values.\r\n\r\n",
